Generate a public comment **in favor of** *Vision Zero by year 2030 in Seattle*

#### Output

> My name is [Name] and I am here to express my support for Seattle’s Vision Zero plan by 2030.

> Any preventable death – especially those that involve walking and bicycling – is always a tragedy. Therefore, I am proudly in support of Seattle's Vision Zero plan to eliminate all traffic-related deaths and serious injuries on the city's roads. By doing so, Seattle can become an even safer and more vibrant place to live, work and play.

> Vision Zero will help to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries by setting an engineering standard, elevating the discussion on safety, strengthening enforcement, and increasing public awareness. As a resident of Seattle, I am thrilled to know that our city government is taking strides to help ensure the safety of all road users.

> In addition, Vision Zero will prioritize the most dangerous areas by targeting resources and developing strategies. We know that there are far too many areas with dangerous road conditions, crosswalks, and intersections, and I believe that Vision Zero will provide much-needed relief. A safe and healthy city relies on walkable and bike-friendly streets.

> The bottom line is that no loss of life on Seattle's roads is acceptable. Kudos to the city for making a commitment to Vision Zero in Seattle! I urge the city to stay the course, develop a comprehensive action plan, and to be ambitious when it comes to achieving this goal.

> Thank you for your time and for considering my comments on this important issue.
